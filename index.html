            ## Safety Over Liveness

            Jared Crace - The Staking Awakening

            * Explain challenges the staking at scale.
            * They have solutions to scale
            ---
            ## What is staking?
            * You, me anyone can participate in the network to do the work.
            * Blockchain cannot work if new blocks are not added
            * Token holders earn rewards by staking digital assets in PoS blockchain
            * Aligns interests of token holders and network operators. Token holderss run, maintain and benefit from network
            * Required - Lockup tokens in the chain. like a security deposit for the job.Like you might have to gave 5x-10x your salary to your boss. if you lied, cheat, still, that security deposit is de-funded. if you do your job, the security will come with you.
            * Nodes vote on block to add block to the chain
            ---
            ### Staking is not
            * lending liquidity, provisioning or any other DeFi activity
            ---
            ## Ethereum node and validator background
            * Execution Client
            * can service many clients
            * Consensus Client
            * Validator Client
            ---
            ### Cryptographic keys
            * Real world - Keys lock/unlock car, house etc; Signatures sign documents, DNA/Biometric establish
            ---
            ## Staking rewards and penalties
            * Rewards - proposing new blocks, attesting new blocks
            * Penalties - Being offline, attesting to invalid/contradicting blocks
            * Slashing - incorrect signing of blocks in same slot, creating contradictory forks, double signing indetical keys running on 2 different validators simultaneously
            ---
            ### Slashing
            * malicious actos
            * over enginerring infrastructure soltions
            * mistaked made when migratiing validator clients
            * implementation
            ---
            ## staking at scale
            * design infrastructure, tooling 
            * secure, safe, scalable and speed
            * secure - key security
            * safe - slashing protection, penalty precautions
            * scalable - automate key generation
            ---
            ## solutions
            * remote signer has access to private keys
            * fleet of validator clients
            * have ways to spin up validator deterministically
            * Shamir's secret may be in secure vault?
